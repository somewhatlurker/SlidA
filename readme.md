## Thinithm

My dumping ground for code to be used with a DIY chunithm/project diva slider I'm working making.  
If you aren't already familiar with it, you probably got here by mistake.

* Code quality is non-existent (not even tested yet)
* Don't ask for help -- this isn't ready
* More info coming in the future (probably)

For now, MIT license (subject to change for future versions)
  * Note: while all code should be problem-free (using independent implementations),
    some hardware details (air tower system) are based on the OpeNITHM design.  
    OpeNITHM uses GPL v3, so please ensure that modifications to the air towers are made public.
